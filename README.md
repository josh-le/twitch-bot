# twitch bot
wow this was a doozie, the twitch documentation for creating a twitch bot is not great, so this took quite a while
# usage
you need to create a twitch application, get the oauth token using the `authentication-node-sample`, get the USER ID of your twitch account, and the USER ID of the twitch account that you would like the bot to respond from(which can just be your own twitch account).

none of which are straight forward. i will write a blog post about all my problems to try to help out others that might run into the same issues.
